We have up and running NXOS with mgmt ip address 192.168.178.142

Must packages:
(venv) $ sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
libffi-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev python3-pip git python3-requests

The ncclient (https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient) library is a Python
library for NETCONF clients. We should also enable our virtual environment that we
created in the last chapter, if not already. We will install ncclient from the GitHub
repository so that we can install the latest version:
(venv) $ git clone https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient
(venv) $ cd ncclient/
(venv) $ python setup.py install
NX-API on Nexus devices is turned off by default, so we will need to turn it on.
We can either use the user that is already created (if you are using VIRL auto-config),
or create a new user for the NETCONF procedures:
feature nxapi
username cisco password 5 $1$Nk7ZkwH0$fyiRmMMfIheqE3BqvcL0C1 role
network- operator
username cisco role network-admin
username cisco passphrase lifetime 99999 warntime 14 gracetime 3
For our lab, we will turn on both HTTP and the sandbox configuration; keep in mind
that they should be turned off in production:
nx-osv-2(config)# nxapi http port 80
nx-osv-2(config)# nxapi sandbox
We are now ready to look at our first NX-API example.
